# Go - Form To Struct

Golang module that allows you to persist form data into structs for storage, sanitation and database operations.

## Motivation
I was recently working on a CRUD app that required receiving user information as form data on the backend. I wanted to easily persist the data to multiple *different* structs at once rather than having to type convert and manually assign each field. I decided to just write this package myself, and use it as an opportunity to learn more about Go, its type system and reflection.
